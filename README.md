# Algorithms for Nim

Showcase of miscellaneous algorithms written in [Nim](https://nim-lang.org/).

This repository attempts to highlight readable and educational solutions, designed for learning and exploration rather than as a production library.

Inspired by my [solutions](https://github.com/remigijusj/aoc-nim) written for [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/).

## Running scripts

The code compiles with the latest (>= v2.2) Nim compiler, for example: `nim c -r shortest_path`.
Each snippet includes tests and will output "OK" if they pass.
